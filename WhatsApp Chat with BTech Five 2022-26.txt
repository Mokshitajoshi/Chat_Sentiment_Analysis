8/25/24, 12:34 - Ayush Kapri Sir: **Second filter stage for SIH will be happening on Thursday, 2 PM onwards.**  
Many groups have misunderstood the project with the actual aim of the project; please go through the description thoroughly.

1. I want a 6-page PPT, strictly in the SIH-given format.
2. Bold only impactful, eye-catching words; ensure that only key highlights are emphasized.
3. Follow the 5:5 rule‚Äî5 pages, each containing 5 key points.
4. These projects are not just about collecting government data, applying a machine learning algorithm, and providing a frontend interface. This SIH is for solving critical problems that India wants to address through the innovative solutions of students. Understanding the problem deeply and seeing it from a perspective that has never been considered before is crucial.
5. If 4th-year students are part of the team, their absence in internal rounds will lead to their removal from the team. Inactive students cause additional workload for other members.
6. Study existing exoskeleton projects and solutions. Watch relevant case studies on YouTube, Google, and read articles to gain comprehensive insights.
7. The ability to answer general knowledge questions related to your topic is a requirement for both external and internal hackathons.

Thanks, see you at Lab2, @Thursday.

8/28/24, 16:14 - +91 99364 18098: *URGENT & IMPORTANT II Email Etiquette for Students* 
I would like to share some of the mistakes students usually make while sending emails.

1. Sending emails without subject line.
2. Typing complete email in Subject Line.
3. Sending emails without Signature.
4. Replying on emails by using reply to all option instead of reply option.

These are some of the examples. So to overcome these errors we all need to work on this. Sharing some of the important tips that you can share with the students.

Professional Email Etiquette for Students
Here are important tips you need to know when writing an email in your professional environment.
 
Include a clear, direct subject line. People often decide whether to open an email based on the subject line. Good subject lines give the reader a preview of what the email is about.
Begin each email with a greeting: Always greet ‚ÄúDear Sir/Ma‚Äôam‚Äù is good etiquette. Otherwise, if you launch into your email without a greeting or introduction you run the risk of seeming impolite or impatient.
End emails in a friendly way: Use ending such as ‚ÄúRegards‚Äù or ‚ÄúHave a great day‚Äù. Even if you use the same ending with everyone, it ends the email in a warm and positive way.
Think twice before hitting Reply All. No one wants to read emails from 20 people that have nothing to do with them. Refrain from hitting Reply All unless you really think everyone on the list needs to receive the email.
Include a signature block. Provide your reader with some information about you, such as your full name, title, course name, campus name, year of passing and your contact information, including a phone number. Use the same font, type size, and color as the rest of the email.
Be cautious with humour. Humour can easily get lost in translation without the right tone or facial expressions. In a professional exchange, it is better to leave humour out of emails unless you know the recipient well.
Proofread every message. Ensure you are using correct spelling and proper grammar. Your mistakes will be noticed by the recipients and you may be judged for making them. Do not rely on spell-checkers. Read and reread your email, preferably aloud, before sending it.

Keep your fonts classic. The ideal font is Arial, size 12 in black. Your emails should be easy for other people to read.

Nothing is confidential--so write accordingly. A basic guideline is to assume that others will see what you write. Don't write anything that would be ruinous to you or hurtful to others.

Use threads: if you get a message from someone and you are going to respond, don‚Äôt send a new message, simply hit the reply option (Avoid using Reply-All Option) on your email, this keeps the original subject line with ‚ÄúRe:‚Äù in front of it.

Be concise: Get to the point of your email as quickly as possible, but don‚Äôt leave out important details that will help your recipient answer your query.

Do not use all CAPS in your emails: This is perceived as yelling in the digital world. If you need to emphasize something, use bold or italics on the points you want to emphasize.

If you are sending an email with an attachment, make mention of it in the body of the email: Write in the email that you are sending an attachment so that the reader knows there is more to the email than just the text.

11/13/24, 18:27 - Akshay Sir: These are some of the Mini Projects which you can build inorder to learn Nodejs.
Those who already know NodeJS can proceed with more complex Projects.


URL Shortener:
Create a URL shortening service that takes a long URL as input and generates a shortened version.

When a user visits the shortened URL, they should be redirected to the original long URL.

You can use Express and a database like MongoDB to store the mappings between the short and long URLs.

Expense Tracker: Develop an expense tracking application where users can input their expenses, categorize them, and generate reports or visualizations of their spending habits.

You can use packages like Chart.js or Plotly.js to create charts and graphs.

File Uploader:
Create a file uploader using Node.js and a package like multer.

Users should be able to select and upload files, which should be stored on the server.

You can add features like file validation, resizing, and handling different file types.

Currency Converter:
Create a currency converter application that fetches real-time exchange rates from an API and allows users to convert between different currencies.

You can use packages like axios to make API requests and display the converted results.

To do App:
Build a command-line to-do list application using Node.js.

Users should be able to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

You can use libraries like readline or inquirer to interact with the user through the command line.

Web Scraper:
Create a web scraping tool that extracts specific information from web pages.

Users should be able to provide a URL and specify the elements or data they want to scrape.

You can use packages like Cheerio or Puppeteer for web scraping.

Authentication System:
Implement user authentication and registration using Node.js and a package like Passport.js.

Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.

You can use a database like MongoDB to store user information securely.


Chat Application:
Build a real-time chat application using Node.js and Socket.IO.

Users should be able to join chat rooms, send messages, and receive messages in real-time.

Socket.IO makes it easy to implement real-time communication between the server and clients.
