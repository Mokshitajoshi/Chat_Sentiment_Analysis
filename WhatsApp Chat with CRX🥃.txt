10/7/24, 16:54 - Prakhar: @916397871885 if we have 6 systems with good configurations.

One acting as the main server as the central point for traffic routing, serving static files, and managing requests to Judge0 instances running on other systems (not for heavy computing)
10/7/24, 16:51 - Sankalp added Prakhar
10/7/24, 16:55 - Prakhar: One system to host database and backups for data
10/7/24, 16:55 - Prakhar: and rest of the systems for judge0 execution node
10/7/24, 16:56 - Prakhar: all system are connected through a common network static IP and lan
10/7/24, 16:57 - Prakhar: I think this system can manage good load
10/7/24, 23:51 - Prakhar: @916397871885 The thing we discussed about the common pattern of the failure of edtech
10/7/24, 23:52 - Prakhar: I read arround 20-30 edtech businesses and There is just one pattern matching in every one of them
10/7/24, 23:53 - Prakhar: They fail in tier-3 and tier-2 cities
10/7/24, 23:54 - Prakhar: in tier-1 cities every student using something very consistently
10/7/24, 23:54 - Prakhar: but there are max 10-15 cities that can be considered in tier 1
10/7/24, 23:57 - Prakhar: maximum croud is in tier2 and tier 3......there is no issue regarding technology very well funded startups having good technical team and outstanding technology fails because their research is very subjective based on the good consumer behaviour
10/8/24, 00:00 - Prakhar: So the scalability issue not lies in anything related to technology but the city
10/8/24, 00:00 - Prakhar: so if we  will work on this specifically then something we can crack
10/8/24, 07:50 - Ayush Kapri Sir: Good work

10/10/24, 13:55 - Prakhar: This is an important message from our mentor: 

It is seen that as we all belong to the tech field but everyone neither contributing nor trying to contribute on this startup which tends to major scalable issue due to dependency on only few of them also it restricts from learning outcomes from this products.
10/10/24, 13:56 - Prakhar: So apart from operations , ideation and resources I invite you all to join this 30 days sprint where we will build monitoring system of this platform from very scratch
10/10/24, 13:57 - Sankalp: take a meet tonight
10/10/24, 14:09 - Prakhar: Term : 1

phase 1: We will start first from designing rough schema for db , then we will use some dummy data in that. 

Phase 2: We will define core models in the schema like students, events, problems etc lo

phase 3 : Creating api endpoint for crud operation.

phase4 : working with db defining collection or tables and then implementation of the schema that we decided 

phase 5: Testing using postman 
then api documentation. 

Term 2 :

Phase 1: Creating lofi design for the interface with group discussion.

Phase 2: Development of the interface (Tracking dashboard, individual student data, student profile, leaderboard)

Phase 3: Api Integration (connect frontend-backend)

Phase 4: after integration testing functionality with dummy data we provide in term-1.
10/10/24, 14:10 - Prakhar: Summary 

1. Backend and database setup with dummy data,Testing and documentation.(2-week)
2. Front-end development (1-week)
3. Integration and testing with documentation.(1-week) <This message was edited>
10/10/24, 14:16 - Prakhar: It will start from today's onwards and i will personally lead this...

Provide email id  whoever  interested 

(Prerequisite: Learn to use git and GitHub, fast api , schema , polling - to fetch data in real time then we will use websocket after the polling )
10/10/24, 14:17 - Prakhar: for frontend basis static frontend knowledge is enough like using bootstrap,css, html, js, copy paste
10/10/24, 14:41 - Prakhar: Db ke lie SQL use krna hai ya no SQL uspe bhi discuss krna hai
10/10/24, 20:27 - Prakhar: initial setup done new repo created whoever want to contribute can start now.......
10/10/24, 21:01 - Prakhar: https://drawsql.app/teams/coderscrux/diagrams/user
10/10/24, 21:02 - Prakhar: aaj ka task yehi hai apne system pe sb setup krke ye schema padho isme bs hme events aur problem solving section bnana hai mysql use krnge
10/10/24, 21:05 - Priyanshu Sir: Okay
10/10/24, 21:06 - Prakhar: to isko aur jada optimize krke naye schema bnane hai

@917579202825 you go with coding contest
@917380480998 you with hackathon
@916307215367 you with quiz
inke lie kaise tables ki requirement hoti to hold data about everything: hosted date, number of participants, students who particepated , score of the students(with time taken,submission,no of test cases executed etc etc)
10/10/24, 21:09 - Prakhar: one thing for consideration we will not make this as mini project type ki kuch bhi add krte jaye jitna ho paye utna optimize krke isko scratch se krna hai aur bina schema ko document kie ye start nhi hoga to kal ispe aate hai fir
10/10/24, 21:09 - Prakhar: kal tk ka he time hai for schema

Minimizing AWS Costs
AWS Kinesis over SQS - In the first version of the data pipeline, Canva used AWS SQS and SNS instead of Kinesis. These were easier to set up however the pricing was significantly higher. By switching to Kinesis Data Streams, Canva saw costs drop by 85%.

Event Compression - Canva‚Äôs servers will first batch the events (in groups of a few hundred events per batch) and apply ztsd compression. These compressed batches will then be sent to Kinesis. Using this strategy (instead of sending each event as a separate record) saves Canva $600k every year in AWS costs.
10/15/24, 00:06 - Prakhar: Free Tier
The Amazon API Gateway free tier includes one million API calls received for REST APIs, one million API calls received for HTTP APIs, and one million messages and 750,000 connection minutes for WebSocket APIs per month for up to 12 months. If you exceed this number of calls per month, you will be charged the API Gateway usage rates.
10/15/24, 00:09 - Prakhar: Free Tier
The Amazon API Gateway free tier includes one million API calls received for REST APIs, one million API calls received for HTTP APIs, and one million messages and 750,000 connection minutes for WebSocket APIs per month for up to 12 months. If you exceed this number of calls per month, you will be charged the API Gateway usage rates.

1M REST API CALLS RECEIVED | 1M HTTP API CALLS RECEIVED | 1M MESSAGES | 750,000 CONNECTION MINUTES

per month

These free tier offers are only available to new AWS customers, and are available for 12 months following your AWS sign-up date. When your 12 month free usage term expires or if your application use exceeds the tiers, you simply pay standard, pay-as-you-go service rates.

HTTP APIs
Pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out. For HTTP APIs, the API Gateway free tier includes one million API calls per month for up to 12 months.

Region:

US East (Ohio)
API Calls
Number of Requests (per month)	Price (per million)
First 300 million	$1.00
300+ million	$0.90
*HTTP APIs are metered in 512 KB increments.
REST APIs
Pay only for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out. There are no data transfer out charges for Private APIs. However, AWS PrivateLink charges apply when using Private APIs in API Gateway. API Gateway also provides optional data caching charged at an hourly rate that varies based on the cache size you select. For REST APIs, the API Gateway free tier includes one million API calls per month for up to 12 months.

Region:

US East (Ohio)
API Calls
Number of Requests (per month)	Price (per million)
First 333 million	$3.50
Next 667 million	$2.80
Next 19 billion	$2.38
Over 20 billion	$1.51
Caching
For better performance and faster API execution, you can optionally provision a dedicated cache for each stage of your APIs. After you specify the size of the cache you require, you will be charged the following hourly rates for each stage's cache, without any long-term commitments.

Cache Memory Size (GB)	Price per Hour
0.5	$0.02
1.6	$0.038
6.1	$0.20
13.5	$0.25
28.4	$0.50
58.2	$1.00
118.0	$1.90
237.0	$3.80
WebSocket APIs
Pay only for messages sent and received and the total number of connection minutes. You may send and receive messages up to 128 kilobytes (KB) in size. Messages are metered in 32 KB increments. So, a 33 KB message is metered as two messages.

For WebSocket APIs, the API Gateway free tier includes one million messages (sent or received) and 750,000 connection minutes for up to 12 months.

Region:

US East (Ohio)
Message Transfers
Number of Requests (per month)	Price (per million)
First 1 billion	$1.00
Over 1 billion	$0.80
Connection Minutes
$0.25 per million connection minutes

Additional Charges
You may incur additional charges if you use API Gateway in conjunction with other AWS services or transfer data out of AWS. For details on AWS service pricing, see the pricing section of the relevant AWS service detail pages. Links to pricing for some of the commonly used services are listed below.

Data transfer
If you use external data transfers, you will be charged at the EC2 data transfer rate

AWS PrivateLink
Includes pricing for each hour that your VPC endpoint is provisioned in each Availability Zone

AWS Lambda
Includes pricing for requests and duration

Amazon CloudWatch
Includes pricing for metrics and dashboards

Pricing Examples
HTTP APIs
Pricing Example 1: An API is used in a Serverless Web Application that invokes Lambda to return dynamic webpage content. The site gets 10,000 page loads per minute. Each API request is 12KB and the response is 46 KB.

10,000 page loads/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month / 1,000,000 = 432 million requests per month.
300 million * $1.00/million = $300
132 million * $0.90/million = $118.8
Total = $418.8 ($0.97 per million)

Pricing Example 2: An API is used for uploading data into your HTTPS backend. The API is called 25 times per minute to upload documents. Each document is, on average, 4.5 MB in size.

25 call/minute * 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day * 30 days/month * 4.5 MB/512 KB/request = 9,720,000 requests per month * $1/million = $9.72
Total = $9.72 

REST APIs
Edge Optimized and Regional APIs

An Edge Optimized or Regional API receives five million API calls per month, with each API call returning responses of 3 kilobytes (KB) in size with no caching.

Example below reflects pricing for US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai)

Amazon API Gateway API call charges = 5 million * $3.50/million = $17.50

Total size of data transfers = 3 KB * 5 million = 15 million/KB = 14.3 GB

Amazon API Gateway data transfer charges = 14.3 GB * $0.09 = $1.29

Total Amazon API Gateway charges = $17.50 + $1.29 = $18.79

Edge Optimized and Regional APIs

An Edge Optimized or Regional API receives 15 billion API calls per month, with each API call returning responses of 4 kilobytes (KB) in size with no caching.

Example below reflects pricing for US East (N. Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Mumbai)

Amazon API Gateway API call charges = 333 million * $3.50/million = $1,165.50

                                                                     667 million * $2.80/million = $1,867.60

                                                                     14 billion * $2.38/million = $33,320.00

Total Amazon API call charges = $1,165.50 + $1,867.60 + $33,320.00 = $36,353.10

Total size of data transfers = 4 KB * 15 billion = 57,220.46 GB

Amazon API Gateway data transfer charges = 57,220.46 GB * $0.09 = $5,149.84

Total Amazon API Gateway charges = $36,353.10 + $5,149.84 = $41,502.94

Private APIs

A Private API receives five million API calls, with each API call having a request size of 0.3 kilobytes (KB) and returning responses of 3 kilobytes (KB). A VPC endpoint is provisioned in 1 Availability Zone (AZ) for the whole month (720 hours).

Example below reflects pricing for US East, US West (Oregon)

Amazon API Gateway API call charges = 5 million * $3.50/million = $17.50

Total Amazon API Gateway charges = $17.50

Total size of data transfers (Request + Response) = (3 KB + 0.3 KB) * 5 million = 16.5 million/KB = 15.7 GB

VPC Endpoint charges = 720 hours * $0.01/AZ/hr = $7.20

VPC Endpoint data processing charges = 15.7 GB * $0.01/GB = $0.16

Total Amazon VPC (AWS PrivateLink) charges = $7.20 + $0.16 = $7.36

Total charges = $17.50 + $7.36 = $24.86

Pricing Example with Caching Required (US East, US West, EU (Ireland))

If your API needs 1.5 GB of cache for its data, you can provision a 1.6 GB cache at $0.038/hr.

$0.038 * 24 = $0.912/day

WebSocket APIs
Chat Application: 1000 users are connected to the chat application for 12 hours in a day. Each user sends 100 messages and receives 500 messages per day. Each message size is 3KB.

Example below reflects pricing in US East (N. Virginia)

Messaging Cost

Total messages per month = (100 (sent msgs) + 500 (received msgs)) * 1000 (users) * 30 (days) = 18M

Total messaging cost = 18,000,000/1,000,000 * $1.00 (per million) = $18

Connectivity Cost

Total connection minutes per month = 1000 (users) * 12 (hrs) * 60 (mins) * 30 (days) = 21,600,000

Total connectivity cost = 21,600,000/1,000,000 * 0.25 (cost per million) = $5.40

Total Cost = $18 (Messaging cost) + $5.40 (Connectivity cost) = $23.40 <This message was edited>

11/6/24, 13:14 - Prakhar: We will have a meeting around 9 to 10 pm tonight....I need the presence of everybody today
11/6/24, 20:56 - Mokshita Joshi: https://meet.google.com/ibs-bjah-nzp
11/6/24, 20:56 - Mokshita Joshi: join at 9:30
11/11/24, 15:54 - Prakhar: Hello everybody,

Consider this is day one after failing to build a company consider you all have spent 2 years building a scalable tech with 8 fellow met all from tech background. 
Consider that you all have switched yourself to make something similar but far better.

There are four things to do 
1. Coding engine 
Everything related to run and submission from interface to backend will be fulfilled by ayush sir and jeevan before 20th of November.

2. Test- Case generator 
 generation of random test cases to valid rest cases will be fulfilled by mokshita and someone else before 20th of November.

3. Data-driven dashboard 
Any component of the platform that deals to show and share data to user side , club side, college side , company side in every form like leaderboard, student assessment report, student engagement, count of student ,profile of students etc everything related to these will be fulfilled by the rest of the team. For this we will make separate micro services with frontend , backend, db.
this also should be completed by 20th of November. 


4: Traction of MVP: 
Whatever we will make by 20th we will consider that as MVP and we will push to market with 5 college to gather traction and report this we will do by end of this month.
11/11/24, 15:57 - Prakhar: So there will be three teams working together with task allocated, mokshita will allocate task in structure manner regular meeting and updation on task will be done by every single person no discussion will be entrained in case of failure. We have worked as a fellow student and friends and brothers now it's time to work as corporate slave for 20 days without failing the timeline.
11/11/24, 17:41 - Prakhar: @916261118964 are you alive or dead??
11/11/24, 17:42 - Priyanshu Sir: Same question
11/11/24, 17:44 - Prakhar: slack pe active rehna sab ab se
11/11/24, 18:34 - Mokshita Joshi: Git ka id bheg dena sab

11/11/24, 18:41 - Priyanshu Sir: In a min
11/11/24, 18:41 - Priyanshu Sir: *
11/11/24, 20:18 - +91 62611 18964: Alive
11/12/24, 15:32 - Mokshita Joshi: I am currently working on test case Generations for coding problems and I am currently stuck at a point.
So at first we were thinking of putting some randomly generated test cases which are very easy to crack, The test cases which are randomly generated do not necessarily cover the edge cases. 
So we came across a method in which we generate the maximum number of test cases possible and then make clusters of it and from those clusters extract 5-10 clusters from each and then again filter them.
I wanted to keep the number of test cases very low but all of them to test every aspect of the algorithm or code. 

In the beginning we were thinking of clustering them on the basis of the output, but there are two major problems related to that:
1- clustering them on the basis of output are clustering them on a single cluster and making it difficult to remove the outliers.
2- It is getting quite a task to cluster according to the output, as there are too many variations of the output for each output one cluster need to be made.

I came across one solution to that which is generate random test cases and cluster them according to the their features like mean, median, min, max, etc. but this can also be a problem as some edge cases can also get missed.
So, I need you guys to help me out regarding this methods for clustering.
11/12/24, 15:33 - Sankalp: This message was deleted
11/12/24, 15:34 - Prakhar: this should not to be discussed here regarding study things
11/12/24, 15:34 - Sankalp: my bad
11/12/24, 15:35 - Prakhar: it will not work
11/12/24, 15:37 - Prakhar: was thinking the same but you will not able to automate this...yes one thing you can do is to exclude outliers and put edge cases manually(initially) then keep training a model with that data
11/12/24, 15:38 - Prakhar: maybe by this you can cover 20-30% but not fully
11/12/24, 15:39 - Priyanshu Sir: Wouldn't that be too much of manual work
11/12/24, 15:39 - Priyanshu Sir: ?
11/12/24, 15:39 - Priyanshu Sir: Just asking
11/12/24, 15:39 - Mokshita Joshi: This is what we have to do
11/12/24, 15:39 - Prakhar: yes it is
11/12/24, 15:40 - Mokshita Joshi: but clustering them on the basis of output is just a waste
because clusters are formed to figure out the pattern among the data 
and if we do that as per the output we are already defining the pattern in the data itself
11/12/24, 15:42 - Mokshita Joshi: I thought maybe on the basis of the deviation and the central tendency of the data will work but initially it will only work for like 40 to 50 percent of the test cases
11/12/24, 15:44 - Mokshita Joshi: I guess initially we have to manually write the edge cases and we can generate some test cases that can do its job
11/12/24, 15:45 - Mokshita Joshi: for the long run 
I will need some sort of data or pattern which I can provide 
randomly generating test cases will do its job but not to the extent we want
11/12/24, 15:45 - Priyanshu Sir: Hnn
11/12/24, 15:47 - Mokshita Joshi: first: I am still blurry about the concept of mapping on what parameters 
second: I need to have a pattern on number of questions that are going to be uploaded
If anything clicks , Do share..
11/12/24, 17:06 - Prakhar: i think you need to focus on the patterns and types of test cases instead of questions
11/12/24, 21:53 - Mokshita Joshi: update your work of the day in git till midnight.
11/12/24, 21:54 - +91 62611 18964: Mam is there anything I can do?
11/12/24, 22:00 - Mokshita Joshi: I'll let you know 
We'll discuss in the next meet..
11/17/24, 11:17 - +91 62611 18964: what you guys doing? 20th November is coming. Any update on mvp? .
11/17/24, 11:21 - Prakhar: 1. Coding engine gonna handle 5000 submissions per day.
2. Dashboard for college  (visibility of all relevant data to monitor).
3. Test- case generator (initially it will just generate random cases in which we have to add edge cases manually)
4. Meeting with alakh pandey (PW skills team)
11/17/24, 11:22 - Prakhar: these are  going to be done before that and we are on time most of the work done
11/17/24, 11:23 - +91 62611 18964: So by 20 we can see it live right? @919555915047
11/17/24, 11:24 - Prakhar: Naaa on 20 we will test everything you may see live between 20-25.
11/17/24, 11:24 - Prakhar: And i want you after 20
11/17/24, 11:24 - Prakhar: just you and me for the operations
11/17/24, 11:25 - +91 62611 18964: Good good good
